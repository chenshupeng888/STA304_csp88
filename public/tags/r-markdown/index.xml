Abstract In capitalist countries, popular satisfaction with the federal government often determines whether it wins elections.In this paper we explore the 2019 CES dataset, which was a non-probability survey1 conducted in the lead-up to the 2019 Federal Election. We found that people’s education level is closely related to their satisfaction with the federal government. Our findings have certain reference value to the governing party’s re-election.</description>
